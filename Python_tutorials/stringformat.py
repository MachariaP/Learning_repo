    #String Format
#To combine strings and numbers use the format() method:
#The format() method takes the passed arguments, formats them, and places them in the string where the placeholders {} are:
age = 36
txt = "My name is John, and i am {}"
print(txt.format(age))

#The format() method takes unlimited number of arguments, and are placed into the respective placeholders:
quantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want {} pieces of item {} for {} dollars."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))

#You can use index numbers {0} to be sure the arguments are placed in the correct placeholders:
uantity = 3
itemno = 567
price = 49.95
myorder = "I want to pay {2} dollars for {0} pieces of item {1}."
print(myorder.format(quantity, itemno, price))
