## 📌 Quick Reference

**What is Middleware?**
> Middleware is like a security checkpoint at an airport - it sits between the incoming request and your application, checking, modifying, or blocking requests before they reach your code.

**Why Learn Middleware?**
- Add functionality to ALL your web pages at once
- Handle authentication and authorization
- Log requests and responses
- Modify data before processing
- Handle errors gracefully
- Improve performance with caching
