## 📌 Quick Reference

**What are Django Signals?**
> Signals are Django's implementation of the Observer design pattern. They allow certain senders to notify a set of receivers when some action has taken place. Think of them as "event listeners" - when something happens, other parts of your code can automatically respond.

**Why Learn Signals?**
- Decouple your application components
- React to model changes automatically
- Send notifications when certain events occur
- Perform cleanup tasks when objects are deleted
- Log activities without cluttering your views
- Create audit trails automatically
