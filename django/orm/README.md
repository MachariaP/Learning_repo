## 📌 Quick Reference

**What is Django ORM?**
> Django ORM is a powerful tool that lets you interact with your database using Python code instead of writing SQL queries. It maps Python objects to database tables, making database operations intuitive and Pythonic.

**Why Learn Django ORM?**
- Write database code in Python, not SQL
- Database-agnostic: works with PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, etc.
- Built-in protection against SQL injection
- Easy relationship handling
- Powerful query capabilities
- Built-in migrations for schema changes
